# Encrpyt-and-Decrypt
This is a GUI-based encryption and decryption tool built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom algorithm that includes binary transformation, substitution, and permutation. The application takes a user message and a key as input, then processes the text to generate an encrypted or decrypted output. It ensures data privacy and makes text unreadable to unauthorized users. The tool visually displays the result in a user-friendly interface with options to encrypt or decrypt using buttons.

Key Features:

Graphical user interface built with Tkinter
